 UI Menus


 Missing:
	* They don't lose focus properly.
		Recommend when bringing up a submenu creating a background div that covers the entire 
		document that when clicked will dismiss/blur the menu, and using z-index to make sure 
		menus and menu-items float above this background.
		Note that this is only relevant to submenus and not context-menus.
	* Hot Keys!
	* reusable menus that can be both context-menu and sub-menu.
